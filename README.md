This python code is a simple system that generates a randomized password that is between 16-20 characters long. The generated password includes special characters, lower and upper case letters, and numbers. The generated password is guaranteed great to pass everysinge one of those terrible requirements that basically every site has for there sign-up.

## Future Updates
- [ ] prevent spaces from being in the final password

### Additional Information
I use the free version of replit and as a result programs close after an hour on inactivity. To keep this bot online all the time, I used uptimerobot which sends requests to the bot in 5 minute intervals to keep the bot online. If you use an IDE without this limitation, delete "keep_alive.py" and the function "keep_alive()" in "main.py" can be deleted.
